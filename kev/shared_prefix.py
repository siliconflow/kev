"""Training forward through a shared state prefix, for the hybrid Qwen3.5 backbones (kev.train --shared_prefix).

The row form (kev.model.forward_rows_batch) trains a record with q questions as q causal rows, state + one branch each,
so the state runs q times. Here each record's state runs once and its branches continue from it, which costs
state + the branches instead of q x (state + branch). The two are the same computation: a branch token attends to the
same tokens at the same positions, and it reaches the state through what each layer leaves behind at the end of the
state, as the layer's own cache path reads it for inference (kev.model._branch_rows_from_prefix): the attention layers'
keys and values, and the Gated DeltaNet layers' short-convolution window (the conv's left context) and recurrent state
(the chunked delta rule's `initial_state`, which fla differentiates). Two things differ from serving:
- `Prefix` holds that per-layer state functionally (transformers' cache layers copy into static buffers in place, which
  autograd cannot see through), so every branch's gradient flows back into the state and accumulates there;
- each decoder layer runs its state pass and its branch pass inside one step, and gradient checkpointing (when the
  backbone has it on) recomputes the step as a whole, so no cache outlives its layer or is written twice on replay.
States of a batch are left-padded (the padded positions are zeroed and stay zero: a zero input leaves the DeltaNet state,
the conv window and the residual stream unchanged), branches right-padded.
Exactness: fp32 with transformers' reference kernels matches the row form to ~1e-5 (logits and every gradient; tiny
random Qwen3.5 in tests/test_unit.py, Qwen3.5-0.8B-Base in tests/test_model.py). On CUDA fla's Triton kernels round their
fp32 dots like TF32, and there the difference stays within the row form's own difference between two batchings.
