# Kev on Modal — study workflow

All GPU work in this repo goes through two files. Never train large models locally (a 32 GB Mac swaps with an 8B in bf16 while Chrome is open).

## Studies (training trials): `modal_app.py`

1. **Plan file** in `experiments/<name>.json`: a list of trial dicts. Allowed keys: `kev/experiment.py::DEFAULTS`, `CHOICES`, plus `base`, `base_revision` (40-hex, required if the suite does not pin the base), `train_sources`, `anchor*`, `init_from` (Hub id[@rev] or `/runs/...` path), `data` (`evals/**/*.jsonl`), `replay` (int). Validate locally first:
   `uv run python -c "from pathlib import Path; from kev.experiment import load_plan; print(len(load_plan(Path('evals/v7/decision-v7'), Path('experiments/X.json'))))"`
2. **Deploy if `kev/*.py` changed** (the launcher refuses otherwise: "deployed app has different kev/*.py"): `uv run modal deploy modal_app.py`. Redeploying while trials run is safe — in-flight containers keep their image — but wait for trials that are seconds from finishing if you can.
3. **Launch** (server-side fan-out; survives disconnects):
   `uv run modal run modal_app.py::study --suite evals/v7/decision-v7 --plan experiments/X.json --name X --transfer evals/v4/transfer-v4 --budget 30 --timeout 5400`
   Names are immutable: a failed study needs a new name (`X2`). Timeout max 14400. Bound cost is printed; H100 ≈ $3.95/h.
4. **Monitor**: `uv run modal app logs kev-research | grep -a -E "step .*/|evaluated|Error" | tail`. Per-trial status without logs:
   ```python
   import json, modal
   for name, cid in json.load(open("runs/X.spawn.json"))["calls"].items():
       fc = modal.FunctionCall.from_id(cid)
       try: print(name, fc.get(timeout=1)["clean_acc"])
       except TimeoutError: print(name, "running")
   ```
   A trial's own log: `uv run modal volume get kev-runs /X/00-trial-0/train.log /tmp/x.log --force`.
5. **Pull** when done: `uv run modal run modal_app.py::pull --name X` → `runs/X/<trial>/{result.json, provenance.json, checkpoint/, transfer/rows.json}`. Then `PYTHONPATH=. uv run python scripts/compare_q35.py` or a paired bootstrap (`kev.benchmark.paired_bootstrap(rows_a, rows_b, metric="acc")`) against the released checkpoint's `transfer/rows.json`.
6. **Locked test** (once per candidate, selected on dev only): `uv run modal run --detach modal_app.py::locked_test --trial X/00-trial-0 --name <candidate> --decision evals/v7/decision-v7`; result at volume `/locked/<candidate>/summary.json`.

Timing (H100, row-batched hybrid): 0.8B ≈ 20 min, 4B ≈ 60 min, 9B ≈ 90 min for the full v7 recipe; deltas (1 epoch over ~1k records + 2k replay) ≈ 10–20 min. Set `--timeout` with ≥ 50 % headroom; a timed-out container loses everything.

## Probes and remote benchmarks: `modal_probe35.py`

Image has transformers 5 + fla; mounts `evals/` and `scripts/` at run time (no deploy step). Run with `--detach` in the background and read the log.

- Untrained-base probe (zero-shot letter logits, same items as every README row):
  `KEV_PROBE_GPU=H200 uv run modal run --detach modal_probe35.py::main --bases Qwen/X-Base --revision <sha> [--suite evals/v9/transfer-v9] [--prompt semif] [--adapter /runs/.../checkpoint --tag name]`
  Output pulled to `runs/probes/<base>-base-<suite>/report.json`. Use H200 for ≥ 30B bf16.
- Benchmark any checkpoint on any suite or `--data` JSONL (`run@suite@name` triples):
  `uv run modal run --detach modal_probe35.py::benchmarks --jobs "jaredpalmer/kev-9b@evals/external/semif-v1@kev-9b-semif,/runs/X/00-trial-0/checkpoint@evals/v9/transfer-v9@x-v9"`
  Output pulled to `runs/<name>/report.json`. Both entrypoints skip names that already exist locally / on the volume.
- Always give the entrypoint (`::main`, `::benchmarks`): the file has several.

## Gotchas
- Symptom "config=... printed, then nothing, and `Modal Client → Modal Worker Heartbeat attempt failed`" = the container is thrashing host memory (checkpoint staging). Check `run_trial`'s `memory=` against the checkpoint size (bf16 bytes ≈ 2 × params); big bases need ≥ weights + 20 GB.
- Training progress is only visible via `modal container logs <ta-id>` (`modal container list` to find it); `modal app logs` shows the last ~50 lines across containers, and the volume's train.log is committed at the end.
- Modal rate-limits app creation: launching more than ~3 detached `modal run`s within a minute fails with "App create rate limit exceeded" (the log shows it; nothing runs). Space launches ≥ 30 s apart or batch jobs into one `benchmarks` call.
- A failed `bench`/`probe` leaves its output directory on the volume; relaunch under a new name (`-2`) or the next run fails with FileExistsError.
- `RuntimeError: aclose(): asynchronous generator is already running` at the end of a detached run is noise; the result line follows it.
- Report dicts must not gain top-level keys that collide with benchmark blocks (`unknowable`, `clean`, `tasks`).
- Modal's HF cache volume (`kev-hf-cache`) persists base weights; first pull of a new base adds minutes.
- Jev calls go through Vercel AI Gateway (`kev.jev`); the key is created with `vercel ai-gateway keys create` (no `--scope`) and kept in the environment only.
