"""CUDA graphs for serving the hybrid (Qwen3.5) backbones on CUDA, batched across requests.

A served request is two kinds of forward pass: the state pass (the document, on a prefix-cache miss) and the row pass (one
causal row per question, continuing the cached state). At a few hundred tokens the GPU finishes a pass long before Python
finishes issuing it: a pass launches ~2,000 kernels, and the flash-linear-attention wrapper around every DeltaNet layer
costs ~1 ms of CPU. Replaying a captured graph issues the same kernels in one call. And because one request leaves most of
the GPU idle, kev.serve hands this module every request that is waiting when the GPU frees up: one state pass computes all
their new states, one row pass all their questions.

Two sets of buffers, shared by every graph:
- the state bank: per layer the attention keys/values [GRAPH_STATES, heads, BANK_WIDTH, dim], each state right-aligned at
  the end, and the DeltaNet conv/recurrent states. The state pass writes new states into it; cached states are copied in.
  One fixed layout, so a row pass reads any state the same way whatever state pass wrote it.
- the row buffers: [rows, heads, Sr + Lb, dim] per attention layer and the DeltaNet states per question row. The row pass
  starts by gathering each row's state from the bank (one index_select per tensor, inside the graph), then writes the
  row's own keys after it.
Both are flat buffers viewed at the graph's shape, so memory is fixed however many shapes appear. Graph keys are kept
coarse because a batch's shape changes with the traffic: state passes by (states, state bucket), row passes by (rows,
row bucket, Sr = the longest state rounded up to a power of two, which only lengthens attention).

A graph has fixed shapes, so passes are padded to buckets: token counts to bucket() (under a quarter more), row and state counts
to count_bucket() (empty entries are masked). The padding is masked exactly:
- the state pass is LEFT-padded. The DeltaNet layers see zeroed inputs at the pads (their padding mask), so keys, values
  and queries are zero and the recurrent state is still zero when the real tokens start; the causal convolution sees
  the same zeros its own padding supplies. The attention layers mask the pads as keys, and a pad query attends to itself
  so no row is fully masked (a NaN there would survive the zeroing: NaN * 0 = NaN). Real tokens keep their position ids.
- question rows are right-padded (after every real token, as the eager path already does); a state's keys are
  right-aligned in the bucket and the slots before them are masked.
So the results equal the eager passes up to floating-point reassociation (another chunking of the DeltaNet scan, other
GEMM shapes), not bit for bit, and a request's answers do not depend on what else shares its batch.

Capturing a graph costs ~0.4 s (an H100, Kev-4B), so the first pass of a new bucket runs the same code eagerly from the
same buffers and the bucket joins `pending`; capture_pending() captures them later (kev.serve does it when no request is
waiting). Replays run one at a time (kev.serve has one model thread), each refills what it reads, and its results are
copied out before the next replay; that is what makes the shared buffers and the shared memory pool safe.
