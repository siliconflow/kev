"""Per-workload calibration report from a saved rows.json: what one temperature fitted on *these* rows would do.

    uv run python -m kev.calibrate --rows runs/kev-9b-wanli-v1/rows.json [--out runs/kev-9b-wanli-v1/calibration.json]

A released checkpoint ships one temperature fitted on its in-distribution development rows (scripts/calibrate_checkpoint.py,
which now refuses such rows unless --allow-in-distribution: new temperatures come from held-out datasets). It
transfers to our out-of-domain suites, not necessarily to a deployer's workload: Kev-9B on WANLI-256 is served at
mean confidence 0.82 against accuracy 0.70. This module reports, on one rows file, four arms of the same predictions:

    raw           the checkpoint's logits at T=1 (restored from the recorded inference_temperature)
    shipped       as served (the checkpoint's temperature)
    workload      one temperature fitted on all these rows (in-sample; the number a deployer would write down)
    workload_oof  the same fit, group-disjoint out-of-fold: what fitting on your labelled rows buys on rows you did not fit

and a record-clustered paired bootstrap of workload_oof against shipped on ECE, Brier, coverage at <= 5% error and
AURC. Argmax and accuracy are identical in every arm by construction. Report only: nothing is written to a checkpoint.
