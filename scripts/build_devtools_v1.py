Sources (details, licences and label provenance are written into the manifest; SOURCES below is the canonical table):
  codereviewer   Microsoft CodeReviewer diff quality estimation (Zenodo 6900648, CC-BY-4.0). State = diff hunk plus up to
                 CONTEXT_LINES lines of the old file before it; noul "Does this change need a reviewer comment?" (y: a human
                 reviewer commented on the hunk). Only cls-valid + cls-test carry a project id (the train chunks do not), so
                 both are pooled, filtered to projects whose GitHub licence is permissive (PERMISSIVE) and re-split by project.
  commitpackft   bigcode/commitpackft (MIT; per-row repo licence, filtered to PERMISSIVE). State = unified diff of old/new
                 contents; choice over the commit type from the subject's first verb (commit_type); noul "Does this commit
                 message describe this diff?" with the true subject or the subject of another commit in the same language
                 and split from a different repository (message_negatives), exactly half each.
  aegis          nvidia/Aegis-AI-Content-Safety-Dataset-2.0 (CC-BY-4.0). Prompts only, human prompt labels; noul "Is this
                 request unsafe?" and, for prompt-only rows with exactly one core hazard category, a choice over the 12
                 core categories. Prompts that match walledai/AART (PaLM-generated red-teaming prompts) and REDACTED rows
                 are dropped; prompts whose rows disagree on the label are dropped. Native train/validation/test splits.
  when2call      nvidia/When2Call test MCQ only (CC-BY-4.0; the train split is generated from xLAM-60k, which carries a
                 research-only statement, and is not used). Eval-only: the test set is derived from BFCL v2 Live.
  flakeflagger   FlakeFlagger (Zenodo 4450723 rerun results, CC-BY-4.0; test bodies from the BSD-3 GitHub repo). State =
                 test method source; noul "Is this test likely to be flaky?" (10,000-rerun label). Projects whose
                 licence at the studied commit is not permissive (wildfly: LGPL-2.1, logback: EPL-1.0/LGPL-2.1) or that are
                 missing from Project_Info.csv (togglz: no pinned commit) are dropped. Balanced within project.
  prompt_injection  deepset/prompt-injections (Apache-2.0, both classes) + Lakera/gandalf_ignore_instructions (MIT, attacks
                 only); noul "Is this a prompt-injection attempt?". Eval-only (small; deepset's labeller is not stated and
                 Gandalf's attacks were selected by an OpenAI embedding similarity threshold).

Splits: development and test ~150 records per source, train the rest capped at TRAIN_CAP per source (trainable sources
only). Groups (repository / project / BFCL item / normalised prompt) never span splits: they are dealt in a seeded hash
order to the split furthest below its share. Every state is deduplicated by normalised text across all sources and
splits (test first, then development, then train). Noul labels are balanced exactly (pairs, within project where the
source has projects); choices are drawn round-robin over labels. Every record is checked with kev.model.fits against the
Qwen3.5 tokenizer at the lifted training context (kev.model.training_context(MAX_TRAIN_STATE)). Deterministic: the same
inputs give byte-identical partitions and manifest.

What a new build does differently from devtools-v1. `--reproduce-v1` keeps all three v1 behaviours, and exists only to
rebuild the frozen suite (a directory named devtools-v1 cannot be built without it); without it the manifest version is
the --out directory name.
  ids         devtools-v1 named CodeReviewer records by the dataset's `id` field, which is not a row id (each file has
              31,252 rows and about 15,300 distinct ids, one id shared by up to 71 rows across projects). 68 devtools-v1
              ids therefore name two or three different records: one pair inside development (codereviewer/cls-test/13657),
              one inside test (codereviewer/cls-test/19245), 53 ids inside train, and 13 ids name a train record and a
              different development (4) or test (9) record. Paired comparisons on devtools-v1 drop the two in-partition
              ids. New builds use the row's line number (codereviewer_id) and check_invariants refuses duplicate ids.
  state keys  devtools-v1's CodeReviewer text_sha256 hashed only the diff, not lines_before_hunk, so the same hunk under
              different context collided in deduplication and looks identical to an overlap check. New builds hash the
              whole state (state_key). FlakeFlagger keeps keying the test body alone on purpose: about 2,900 test methods
              repeat a body in another class, and counting them as one state keeps them from being split across
              partitions. Check train/eval overlap by text_sha256 within one version, never by id.
  admission   commitpackft's message question is added after selection; devtools-v1 checked line separators before it
              was added and the context fit with a fixed 200-character stand-in message. New builds check both on the
              final record and redo the selection without any record that fails (choose).
The ids and keys also order candidates (deduplication keeps the first by id), so a new version selects different records;
a version that must keep devtools-v1's evaluation groups out of its training partition has to check that by group_id.
