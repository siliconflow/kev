"""Training records for the 2026-09-20 overnight deltas (PLAN.md, "Tonight's autoresearch"). Three files under evals/night2/,
each in the --data JSONL format (kev.data.load_records), plus a manifest with hashes. Frozen: rerunning must reproduce the bytes.

  dates.jsonl       date-bearing policy families (trainable ones; `deadline` stays held out) rendered three ways at random:
                    plain (as decision-v7), with a relational day-count sentence that names the roles ("The return request was
                    submitted 23 days after the purchase."), or with a `date_facts` field identical to what kev.api.with_date_facts
                    produces at serving time. Teaches the model to consume a stated day count and to bind a generic date fact to
                    the policy's roles (issue #8).
  unknowable.jsonl  contrastive records with the deciding evidence sentence removed, soft target = uniform over the options, plus
                    their intact controls with hard labels. Trainable families only. Teaches "no evidence -> no confidence".
  assertion.jsonl   Noul questions phrased as statements ("This article is about business.") built from public choice/noul records
                    in decision-v7's training partition, balanced true/false. scienthoon's "The customer sounds angry." failure.
